                Irene applied for a job through an international recruitment agency that connected household workers with families in the
                U.S. She accepted a job with a California couple who promised they would pay her $1,500 a month and sponsor
                her temporary work visa. Upon her arrival, they forbade Irene from ever leaving the home, always arming the
                security system to keep her confined. For 18 hours a day, Irene cooked, cleaned, and cared for the children,
                but was never paid.

                Jasmine was 18 years old when she ran away from her home in Missouri with her 19-year-old boyfriend Steven. 'Now that we’re
                going to live together, you’ll need to earn some money,' Steven told her. And then he drove her to a truck
                stop on a local interstate. Every night, Jasmine was taken to a different truck stop and forced to go door
                to door offering commercial sex.
